Hi, **Piyush** here. A Software Engineer with experience working on and building full-stack applications. Currently, I'm an active maintainer of [Monkeys](https://monkeys.com.co).

I can work with every tech stack or technology, but what I've used till now is mentioned below.

- React.js • Next.js
- React Native
- TypeScript • JavaScript
- Golang
- C++ (as long as I'm doing DSA)
- PostgreSQL • SQLite • MongoDB

Apart from technical experience, I also honed my skills in UI/UX as I always had a thing for designing. Currently, I'm trying to get more grasp of the mobile development and backend ecosystem.
